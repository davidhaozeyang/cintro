Chapter 2

Sizing up C types and their limits, int and char arrays, and incrementing pointers

Not all bytes are 8 bits?

How many bits are there in a byte?
	At least 8

How many bytes are there in a char?
	1

How many bytes the following are on your machine?
int, double, float, long, and long long
	int - 4
	double - 8
	float - 4
	long - 4
	long long - 8

Follow the int pointer

On a machine with 8 byte integers:
int main(){
    int data[8];
} 
If the address of data is 0x7fbd9d40, then what is the address of data+2?
	0x7fbd9d48


What is data[3] equivalent to in C?
Hint: what does C convert data[3] to before dereferencing the address?
	0x7fbd9d4c

sizeof character arrays, incrementing pointers

Remember, the type of a string constant "abc" is an array.

Why does this segfault?
char *ptr = "hello";
*ptr = 'J';
	String is immutable 
What does sizeof("Hello\0World") return?
	12
What does strlen("Hello\0World") return?
	5
Give an example of X such that sizeof(X) is 3.
	"bfr"
Give an example of Y such that sizeof(Y) might be 4 or 8 depending on the machine.
	A pointer is 4 bytes on 32bits machines and 8 bytes on 64bits machines
