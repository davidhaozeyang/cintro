Program arguments, environment variables, and working with character arrays (strings)

Program arguments, argc, argv

What are two ways to find the length of argv?
	1. Call argc
	2. Loop through argv until reaches nil
What does argv[0] represent?
	1. The name of the program

Environment Variables

Where are the pointers to environment variables stored (on the stack, the heap, somewhere else)?
	- Environment variables are stored together with command line arguments at the top of the process memory layout, above the stack.
String searching (strings are just char arrays)

On a machine where pointers are 8 bytes, and with the following code:
char *ptr = "Hello";
char array[] = "Hello";
What are the values of sizeof(ptr) and sizeof(array)? Why?
	- sizeof(ptr) is 8 bytes, because it's just a pointer pointing to the first memory location
	- sizeof(array) is 6 bytes, because sizeof() will count the all the char until it sees '/0'

Lifetime of automatic variables

What data structure manages the lifetime of automatic variables?
	- Stack
